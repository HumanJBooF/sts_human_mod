# sts_human_mod
Attempted to create a mod for the steam game Slay the spire.

Using _defaultMods_, base set up and placeholder images for now.
All images will be changed as time goes on, This is my first mod so I am going to take it little by little.


*Bison* mod will be the only dog character in the Slay universe (I _think?_)

### Upcoming plans
* Full Dog based deck
* Dog Relics
* Dog Character images
* Dog Badge
* Whatever else I can figure out how to do
